# W3C TAG Specification Reviews

This repository is for specification reviews by the [W3C Technical Architecture Group](http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/); usually (but not always) from W3C Working Groups.

We use the [issues list](https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues) to track our reviews; you can request a review for your spec by adding a new issue.

Note that we do NOT usually use the issue itself to perform the review; we prefer to engage with the specification authors and/or Working Group (as appropriate) directly, using their feedback mechanisms (e.g., issues list, mailing list, WG meetings). 

In some cases, we might prepare a review document, which lives in this repo. Old review documents are moved to the Archive folder.
